# Linear-Regression-model-Initial-Investment-of-franchises
Creating a Linear Regression model to predict the Initial Investment required for a franchise based on the Annual Fee charged by the franchisor in Python.

To construct this model, we used the libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn and statsmodels.

We start by performing an Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataframe, and visualizing the data with the help of histograms and box plots. After that, we calculate the correlation beteween the two variables and create the Linear Regression Model. Finally, we predict new values for the Initial Investment using the model.
